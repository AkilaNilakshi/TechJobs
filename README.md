I hope you already cloned the project to your local machine through the github link i shared. 

Step 1 
  - Run "npm install" in your command promt
Step 2
  - Once finished downloading the node modules, Run "npm run dev" in your command prompt.

You can access the working assignment (So far i have completed) "http://localhost:3000"
